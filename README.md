# Sudoku Solver

### Description
This script solves any sudoku board using the Backtracking Algorithm. Give the board as a text file and let the script print the result.

### How to Use
It is pretty straightforward to use the script. As the print_usage() shows, to run the script:

1) Compile the script using ``` gcc main.c -o main ```
2) Provide a board file (you may look into board.txt file)
3) Run this command``` ./main.c <board_file> ```

### Attention

You may confuse about how to format your board file. The best way is to do it like the board.txt file. You do not have separate numbers using commas and spaces. Either one of these or some other punction marks are okay to use. You can even go further and not use any separator between digits and write each one of them concatenated, replacing unknown values with 0.

Any improvement is appreciated. If you can see some flaws in the current program, do not hesitate to create an issue or a PR.
